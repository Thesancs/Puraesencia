## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant green (#5CB85C), conveying growth and harmony, crucial for appealing to the health and wellness market, which may otherwise expect to see stereotypical relaxing or therapeutic colors. To prevent such association, a slightly different hue might better engage the imagination of women looking for entrepreneurial paths.
- Background color: Light desaturated green (#F0F8F0), providing a clean and calming backdrop that complements the primary color without overwhelming the visual experience.
- Accent color: Yellow-green (#B0E074), brightening specific sections like call-to-action buttons, guiding users smoothly.
- Font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif), providing a modern and readable look suitable for headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Minimalist design with ample spacing, fluid scrolling, and clear section divisions to guide the user's eye towards conversion points.
- Flat, outline icons (Lucide or Heroicons) in green to reinforce the natural and accessible themes.
- Subtle hover effects on buttons and cards (scaling and fade), plus smooth fade-in animations on section load to maintain engagement.
